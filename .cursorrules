# notifications-service Rules

- Purpose: Notification delivery and related entities. Node/Express with pnpm; source under `app/src`.
- Commands:
  - Install: `cd app && corepack enable && pnpm i`
  - Dev: `cd app && pnpm watch`
  - Build: `cd app && pnpm build:all`
- Conventions:
  - Services in `lib/services`, entities/schemas in their respective dirs, config in `lib/config`.
  - Use shared wrappers from `markly-ts-core` (e.g., BullMQ, Logger, Config) when applicable.
  - Keep diffs minimal; maintain strong typing.
- Cross-service:
  - For new events/contracts, first add types to `markly-ts-core` and update all producers/consumers.
